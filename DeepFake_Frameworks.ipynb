    "### **Difference Between Two Frameworks: EfficientNetB4 vs. EfficientNetB4 + PGMs**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **EfficientNetB4-based framework** is a pure **deep learning approach** that classifies images as real or deepfake by learning **hierarchical features from images**. In contrast, the **EfficientNetB4 + PGMs hybrid framework** combines deep learning with **probabilistic graphical models (PGMs)** to **enhance interpretability, uncertainty estimation, and robustness**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## **1. EfficientNetB4 Framework (Deep Learning Only)**\n",
    "Link: https://www.kaggle.com/code/armanzhalgasbayev/deepfake-detection-efficientnetb4-tf-cnn?utm_source=chatgpt.com\n",
    "### **How It Works:**\n",
    "1. **Preprocess Input**: Resize images to 224x224, normalize pixel values.\n",
    "2. **Feature Extraction**: EfficientNetB4 learns feature representations automatically.\n",
    "3. **Classification**: A **fully connected layer** with a **sigmoid activation** predicts **real (0) or fake (1)**.\n",
    "4. **Training & Optimization**: Uses **binary cross-entropy loss**, **SGD optimizer**, and backpropagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Strengths:**\n",
    "✔ Fully **automated feature learning** – no manual feature engineering required.  \n",
    "✔ **High accuracy** when trained on large datasets.  \n",
    "✔ Can be **fine-tuned** using transfer learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Weaknesses:**\n",
    "❌ **Black-box model** – lacks interpretability.  \n",
    "❌ **Overfitting risk** – may not generalize well to new deepfake techniques.  \n",
    "❌ **No uncertainty estimation** – cannot express confidence in predictions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. EfficientNetB4 + PGMs Framework (Hybrid Approach)**\n",
    "This hybrid framework **separates feature extraction and classification**:\n",
    "- **EfficientNetB4** extracts **deepfake-relevant features**.\n",
    "- **PGMs (Bayesian Networks / Markov Random Fields)** analyze probabilistic dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How It Works:**\n",
    "1. **Feature Extraction (EfficientNetB4)**  \n",
    "   - Extracts features related to **GAN artifacts, edge distortions, texture inconsistencies, frequency domain artifacts, and facial symmetry issues**.\n",
    "   - Outputs a **feature vector** instead of direct classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Probabilistic Inference (PGM)**\n",
    "   - **Bayesian Network (BN)**: Models probabilistic dependencies among features (e.g., if **GAN artifacts exist, edge distortions are likely**).\n",
    "   - **Markov Random Field (MRF)**: Detects **spatial inconsistencies** in images by modeling local dependencies between pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Final Decision Fusion**\n",
    "   - Combines Bayesian inference results and MRF outputs.\n",
    "   - Computes **final probability P(DeepFake | Extracted Features).**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Strengths:**\n",
    "✔ **More interpretable** – explicitly models relationships between features.  \n",
    "✔ **Improved generalization** – Bayesian models can adapt to new deepfake techniques.  \n",
    "✔ **Uncertainty estimation** – PGMs can quantify **how confident** the model is in its decision.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Weaknesses:**\n",
    "❌ More **complex** to implement.  \n",
    "❌ Requires **manual definition** of feature dependencies in PGMs.  \n",
    "❌ **Higher computational cost** due to probabilistic inference.  \n",
